My data collection through programming was from using Mimi's script provided in week 8 folder. I modified it to ask me what my favorite number is every day. This was the code:

```
import csv
import os.path
from datetime import datetime 
import schedule
import time

def recorder():
    file_exists = os.path.isfile("feels1.csv")

    with open("feels1.csv", 'a') as outfile:
        response = int(raw_input(" What is your favorite number today from 1 to 10? "))
        timestamp = datetime.now().time()

        writer = csv.writer(outfile)
        
        if not file_exists:
            headers = ['Timestamp', 'Number']
            writer.writerow(headers)
        
        writer.writerow([timestamp, response])
        print ("Recorded")

schedule.every(2).minutes.do(recorder)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```
The results were saved each morning that I remembered to do the survey.

From the data collected manually, I chose to write down each day a word I thought randomly of and trace its origins.
