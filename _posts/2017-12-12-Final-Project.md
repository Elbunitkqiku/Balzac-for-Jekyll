Inspired by Salvador Dali's "Geopoliticus Child Watching the Birth of the New Man", I will examine the US sponsored coups and US invasions in different country from 1946 to 2003. I will put this data on a map, showing which parts of the world have been most affected by these coups and invasions. Apart from this, I related this to another map which I made, showing american films which were made about the invasions and the number of them. This is related to the US government's role in the production of hollywood films, as according to data I gathered, the CIA and NSA worked in over 800 films and 1000 TV shows made in America. These two maps are related by how the US foreign affairs work and how they are justified to the population.  On both maps I will also talk about what the data is not representing, considering the historical context and so on.
