Maciej Ceglowski's "The Internet With a Human Face" brings to light, in a way, a new, updated version of panopticism. Panopticism is a theory developed by Michel Foucault in his book "Discipline and Punish." Foucault developed this after the concept of the panopticon, which is a circular building with a watch-tower in the centre, and prison cells on the walls. A guard is stationed at the watch-tower shining light around the cells, while the prisoners cannot see each other as they are separated by concrete walls. This way the prisoners have no way of knowing whether they are being observed. This then forces the prisoners to self-police; to behave from the fear of being observed and punished. Foucault believed that the state and society was structured according to the panopticon.
 	

The gathering of data that Ceglowski mentions and the internet's memory then remind me of a new updated version of panopticism. One of the updated traits of it is memory.  While with the help of today's technology surveillance is present at most times; it also has an enormous storage of memory of the individuals that have been surveilled. Therefore, the individual has to be alert all the time to not make one single wrong-doing or misbehavior that the society of this time deems unfavorable. This then becomes a useful tool for the state in order to exercise power to its subjects - the individuals. As Ceglowski explained that the private companies that gather all these data on individuals using the products of these companies; these companies have proven to agree to share these information with the state according to him. Thus, memory is an updated trait of panopticism used by the state to be certain that individuals will not misbehave.
 	

Another trait of this is profit through profiling. Through this mass gathering of data and profiling, there is enormous profit to be made through marketing. This leaves some kind of agency to private companies in which they use it to grow their businesses and gain more capital. It can be seen as an exchange between the private companies and the state, where the state allows them to profit and maintain this virtual panopticon as long as they share the information on the individuals that are part of this panopticon. This way it is easier for the state to have access to information without investing too much on surveillance. Hence, profit and this exchange between private companies and the state is another updated trait of the classical panopticon.
 	

In conclusion, my interpretation of Ceglowski's text was a little bit dark but interesting to think about. The private companies are included in the panopticon where they exercise some agency over it, profiting through it and maintaining it, while being allowed by the state to do this as long as they share information about the individuals who have access to these sites. This way the internet can be seen as a virtual panopticon where the users are being surveilled all the time, while also being gold mines for these private companies that maintain it.
