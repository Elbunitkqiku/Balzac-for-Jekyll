Few weeks ago, Facebook shut down multiple solidarity pages for Rojava and multiple personal accounts who were admins or active in such pages. My final project then will take into account how social media has affected Rojava and how European and some North American leftists have been drawn and have shown support towards Rojava. A few months ago there have been posts and comments from both people that have been residing and active in Rojava and from leftists from around the world commenting on them and showing their support. However, there was a crackdown by Facebook on these pages. Thus, I will examine the role of Faceook and maybe other social media in such situations, as they mostly try to maintain an "apolitical" attitude, however they still manage to do such actions. What I am thinking of showing is screenshots printed and maybe framed from these pages, different article headlines related to leftism and also ones related to mainaining the status quo or rightist ones. I will also try to make propaganda posters, either for boths sides, or just for Rojava.
